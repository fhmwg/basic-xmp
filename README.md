The intent of this repository is to provide guidance for people seeking to access XMP data within image files. If you already have a system in place for doing that, this repository is not relevant to you.

I welcome contributions of additional techniques; in particular, I rarely used close-source libraries and have few suggestions on how to interact with them effectively.

All content here is in the public domain and made available under [CC0](LICENSE).
All contributions must also be dedicated to the public domain.
Guides and code with more restrictive copyright, copyleft, or licenses may be linked to but will not be included directly.
Because the contents are in the public domain, they may be used by anyone for any purpose, public or private, without fee, permission, or notice of any kind.

This repository is split into two main parts:

- [blocks/](blocks/) contains guides and code for accessing raw XMP blocks within files
- [rdfxml/](rdfxml/) contains guides and code for handling the part of RDF/XML used in common XMP vocabularies
